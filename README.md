# TAMUHACK-2022
Tamuhack 2022 Project 


This is the tamuhack project


Chases Idea for the project:

Given a name and headshot, Scrape through finding their potential social media. Compare this with a facial scan given the headshot to confirm if this social media is the one in the same, and then, scan each social media picture, and terminology, to determine if the user has a righteous lifestyle. Once the social medias have all been checked, we can then give a final score, that would see if they are liable for a great deal.

Examples of demerits:

Pictures of them with cigarettes

Text that gives a rude and/or negative result

All of this data collection would be legal, as everything would be public information.
